Task 1 - Data Distribution Visualization

Overview This task focuses on visualizing the distribution of multiple numerical features in a dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Earthquake Data Overview

This dataset contains records of earthquake events used for analysis and visualization.

Fields Included:

Latitude / Longitude – Geographic coordinates of the epicenter.

Depth – Depth of the earthquake in kilometers.

Magnitude – Measured strength of the earthquake.

Location – Description of the affected area, often includes the nearest country or region.

Objectives:

Plot Frequency vs Magnitude to observe the relationship between earthquake intensity and how deep they occur.

Identify Top 10 Countries with the most earthquakes to understand regional seismic activity patterns.

Each feature is plotted using a histogram to understand its distribution, along with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) to observe the probability density.
